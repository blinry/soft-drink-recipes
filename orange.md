# blinry orange

A simple orange-flavored soft drink, somewhat resembling Fanta Orange.

Yields enough concentrate for 6 L of soft drink. See the [README](README.md) for general information and safety notes.

## Instructions

Combine

- 4 ml water
- 2 g food-grade gum arabic

in a small glass or ceramic container. Add

- 1.7 ml essential orange oil
- 0.15 ml essential lime oil
- 0.15 ml essential lemon oil

and mix with a hand mixer until an emulsion forms (and the mixture takes on a uniform light brown appearance), this takes about 5-10 minutes. Now add

- 25 ml water
- 12 g citric acid powder
- 0.6 g sucralose

and mix until dissolved. I like to dilute this concentrate to a total volume of 1 L, and then later mix 1:5 with carbonated water.

Optionally, add enough

- yellow food coloring

to make the concentrate deep yellow.

## Changelog

### 0.1.1 - 2021-01-20

- Move 0.1 ml from each lime and lemon to orange.

### 0.1.0 - 2020-09-21

- Initial version, an educated guess. Came out nicely, maybe even less lemon and lime could be nice.

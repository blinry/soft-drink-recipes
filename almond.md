# blinry almond

Combining blood orange and almond, this soft drink tastes like fruity marzipan! A crowd favorite.

Yields enough concentrate for 6 L of soft drink. See the [README](README.md) for general information and safety notes.

## Instructions

Combine

- 4 ml water
- 2 g food-grade gum arabic

in a small glass or ceramic container. Add

- 1 ml essential blood orange oil
- 0.5 ml essential lime oil
- 0.5 ml essential bitter almond oil (hydrogen cyanide-free)

and mix with a hand mixer until an emulsion forms (and the mixture takes on a uniform light brown appearance), this takes about 5-10 minutes. Now add

- 25 ml water
- 12 g citric acid powder
- 0.6 g sucralose

and mix until dissolved. I like to dilute this concentrate to a total volume of 1 L, and then later mix 1:5 with carbonated water.

Optionally, add enough

- orange food coloring

to make the concentrate deep orange.

- Initial version, an educated guess. Super tasty! Pretty heavy on the almond.

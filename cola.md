# blinry cola

A cola without caffeine, using an artificial sweetener.

Yields enough concentrate for 6 L of soft drink. See the [README](README.md) for general information and safety notes.

## Instructions

Combine

- 4 ml water
- 2 g food-grade gum arabic

in a small glass or ceramic container. Add

- 0.75 ml essential orange oil
- 0.70 ml essential lime oil
- 0.20 ml essential lemon oil
- 0.15 ml essential nutmeg oil
- 0.08 ml essential cassia oil
- 0.05 ml essential coriander oil
- 0.05 ml essential lavender oil

and mix with a hand mixer until an emulsion forms (and the mixture takes on a uniform light brown appearance), this takes about 5-10 minutes. Now add

- 25 ml water
- 40 ml caramel color
- 12 g citric acid powder
- 0.6 g sucralose

and mix until dissolved. I like to dilute this concentrate to a total volume of 1 L, and then later mix 1:5 with carbonated water.

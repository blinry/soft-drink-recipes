This is a collection of DIY soft drink recipes:

- [blinry almond](almond.md)

## Safety note

Essential oils and concentrated acids are corrosive and can irritate your skin and eyes. Please take necessary precautions.

## Equipment

- Electric hand mixer.
- Small glass or ceramic container that barely fits your mixer. Don't use a plastic container, as the oils will start to break it down.
- Small syringe with a blunt-tip needle for measuring the oils. Alternatively, 1 ml of essential oil weighs around 0.85 g.
- High-precision weighing scale.

## Sourcing

- [Dragonspice](https://www.dragonspice.de) (Germany): essential oils, gum arabic, citric acid
- [Buxtrade](https://buxtrade.de) (Germany): sucralose, gum arabic, citric acid, vanillin
- Local supermarket: caramel color

## Modifications

Here are some modifications you could make to the recipes:

- Use sugar syrup instead of artificial sweeteners. To replace 0.6 g sucralose, boil 400 g white sugar in 400 ml of hot water.
- Add caffeine powder during the final mixing step. You know best how much you want. Please be careful, the LD50 is only about 10 g.
